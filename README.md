## Overview of the Project 

## Project: Data Processing on Heart Attack Dataset 

## Objective
The objective of this task is to do data processing because before applying any AI algorithms, data often needs to be preprocessed to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This task involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw data for AI model training.


## Key Activities 
**Data Collection:** Ensuring that data is collected from various source and reliable source for good model traning.
**Important Libraries:** Import important libraries for data processing 
**Data Cleaning:** Ensuring that data is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
**Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.


## Technologies Used 
**Python:** The primary programming language for data processing, providing the foundation for writing and executing code.

**pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing you to handle data structures like DataFrames and Series for cleaning, transforming, and summarizing data.

**numpy:** Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. It's often used for numerical computations and array manipulations.

**matplotlib:** A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is useful for generating various types of plots and charts to visualize data.

**seaborn:** Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies the creation of complex visualizations and enhances the aesthetic quality of plots.

**sklearn (scikit-learn):** A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as utilities for model selection and evaluation.
